A solution to host and manage individual Juice Shop instances for
multiple users is
https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/[MultiJuicer]. MultiJuicer is
a Kubernetes based system to start up the required Juice Shop instances
on demand. It will also clean up unused instances after a configured
period of inactivity.

MultiJuicer {multiJuicerVersion} comes with a custom-built load balancer. It allows every
participant (or a CTF team) to use the same URL, but their traffic will
always be sent to their own personal instance.

Registration at MultiJuicer is very straightforward for the users/teams.
Messing with other instances is prevented by assigning a passcode to
each of them which should only be shared among team members - or not at
all for individuals.

MultiJuicer comes with a rudimentary Score Board of its own, which allows teams to compare their progress through
the Juice Shop challenges.

Another helpful feature for the trainer MultiJuicer is the https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/blob/master/guides/monitoring-setup/monitoring.adoc[optional
dashboard which automatically consumes and displays metrics] from each of
its Juice Shop instances. It shows individual challenge progress along with other
functional and technical stats and can be very helpful in
troubleshooting as well.

The MultiJuicer repository offers guidance on https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer#installation-guides-for-specific-cloud-providers[how to set up the
system on different cloud provider platforms],
such as Digital Ocean, OpenShift, AWS or Azure.
