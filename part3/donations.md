# Donations

As a project of the OWASP Foundation the Juice Shop is and always will
be

* open source
* free software

The entire project is licensed under the liberal
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) which allows even
commercial use and modifications. There will never be an "enterprise" or
"premium" version of OWASP Juice Shop either.

This does not mean that a project like it can thrive without any
funding. Some examples on what the OWASP Juice Shop spent (or might
spend) money on:

* Giveaways for conferences and meetups (e.g.
  [stickers, magnets, iron-ons or temporary tattoos](https://www.stickeryou.com/products/owasp-juice-shop/794))
* Merchandise to reward awesome project contributions or marketing for
  the project (e.g.
  [apparel or mugs](http://shop.spreadshirt.com/juiceshop))
* Bounties on features or fixes (via
  [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/juice-shop))
* Software license costs (e.g. an extended icon library)
* Commercial support where the team lacks expertise (e.g. graphics
  design for this book's cover was paid from donations)

## Restricted gifts

All donations >1000 US$ to the OWASP Foundation can be restricted
explicitly to be only used by the Juice Shop project in the current
calendar year. To learn more about such earmarked donations please check
OWASP's
[Rules of Procedure on Donations](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/donations.html).

ℹ️ _While the Juice Shop appreciates such dedicated donations, please
note that these add an organizational overhead for the OWASP Foundation.
To this day no expenses of the categories mentioned above have ever been
denied by OWASP for Juice Shop._

## Attribution

If you tick the "Publicly list me as a supporter of OWASP Juice Shop"
checkbox your name (but obviously **not** your email address) will be
added to the
[_Supporters tab of the project website](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/#div-supporters)
automatically.

size can be at most 300x300 pixels. Logo and name placements are
guaranteed for 1 year after the donation but might stay there longer at
the discretion of the Project Leader.
