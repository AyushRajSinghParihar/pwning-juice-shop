# Provide feedback

* Did you experience a functional bug when hacking the application?
* Did the app server crash after you sent some malformed HTTP request?
* Were you sure to have solved a challenge but it did not light up on
  the score board?
* Do you think you found an _accidental_ vulnerability that could be
  included and tracked on the score board?
* Do you disagree with the difficulty rating for some challenges?
* Did you spot a misbehaving UI component or broken image?
* Did you enjoy a conference talk, podcast or video about OWASP Juice
  Shop that is missing in our
  [references compilation on GitHub](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/REFERENCES.md)?

In all the above (as well as other similar) cases, please reach out to
the OWASP Juice Shop team, project leader or community!
