# Troubleshooting

If (and only if) none of the
[Common support issues](#common-support-issues) described below could
help resolve your issue, please ask for individual support on our
[official Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/bkimminich/juice-shop). If you
are sure to have found a bug in the Juice Shop itself please
[open a üêõ Bug report issue](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=%5B%F0%9F%90%9B%5D+)

## Start-up validations

During server start the Juice Shop runs a series of self-validations and
print feedback about their success to the console:

![Passing start-up validations](img/passing_startup-validations.png)

Juice Shop will resist to launch as long as any of these validations
fail:

![Failing start-up validations](img/failing_startup-validations.png)

The following checks are run during server startup and can typically be
fixed in a straightforward fashion when they fail:

If your installation did not even get to the point of running these
checks _or_ all checks successfully pass with `(OK)` but the application
still fails to start, please check the
[Common support issues](#common-support-issues) for possible hints to
solve your issue.

## Common support issues

The following issues have been seen (and solved/mitigated) more than
once and can hopefully help you to narrow down a solution for your
issue.

### Node.js / NPM

- After changing to a different Node.js version it is a good idea to
  delete `node_modules` and re-install all dependencies from scratch with
  `npm install`
- If during `npm install` the `sqlite3` or `libxmljs2` binaries cannot
  be downloaded for your system, the setup falls back to building from
  source with `node-gyp`. Check the
  [`node-gyp` installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
  for additional tools you might need to install (e.g. Python 2.7, GCC,
  Visual C++ Build Tools etc.)
- If `npm install` runs into a `Unexpected end of JSON input` error you
  might need to clean your NPM cache with `npm cache clean --force` and
  then try again.

### Linux

- If `npm install` fails on Ubuntu with the pre-installed Node.js please
  install the latest release of Node.js {{book.recommendedNodeVersion}}
  from scratch and try again.
- If `npm install` on Linux runs into `WARN cannot run in wd` problems
  (e.g. during the frontend installation step) try running `npm install
  --unsafe-perm` instead.
- ~~If `npm start` fails with `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory,
  copyfile` you might have had either an error already during `npm
  install` _or_ you pulled changes from GitHub but did not re-run `npm
  install` afterwards. Make sure to check if the file to copy from
  exists on your disk and if the target folder for the copy is there.~~
  _(Should no longer occur with v12.0.2 or later)_

### Docker

- If using Docker Toolbox on Windows make sure that you also enable port
  forwarding from Host `127.0.0.1:3000` to `0.0.0.0:3000` for TCP for
  the `default` VM in VirtualBox.
  
### Heroku

- The ["Deploy to Heroku" button on the `README`](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop#deploy-on-heroku-free-0month-dyno) only works from browsers where no plugins or settings interfere with `Referer` HTTP headers

### SQLite

- If all startup checks show `(OK)` but you see `SequelizeDatabaseError:
  SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: <some table name>` errors right
  afterwards, please check if the file `data/juiceshop.sqlite` exists.
  If so just stop and restart your server and this suspected race
  condition issue shouid go away.

### Vagrant

- Using the Vagrant script (on Windows) might not work while your virus
  scanner is running. This problem was experienced at least with
  F-Secure Internet Security.

### OAuth

- If you are missing the _Login with Google_ button, you are running
  OWASP Juice Shop under an unrecognized URL. **You can still solve the
  OAuth related challenge!**
- If you want to manually make the OAuth integration work to get the
  full user experience, create your own customization file and define
  all properties in the
  [`googleOauth` subsection](../part1/customization.md#googleoauth-subsection)

### Challenges

- If you notice that a challenge solution is not working, check on the
  _Score Board_ if that challenge is one of the
  [potentially dangerous ones](../part1/challenges.md#potentially-dangerous-challenges)
  which are by default disabled in Docker environments and shared
  platforms like Heroku.
- You may find it easier to find vulnerabilities using a pen test tool.
  We strongly recommend
  [Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/) which is open
  source and very powerful, yet beginner friendly.
