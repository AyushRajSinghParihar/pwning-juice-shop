# Coding challenges

Starting with `v12.9.0`, OWASP Juice Shop offers a new developer-focused challenge for
some of its existing hacking challenges: Coding challenges. These were [briefly illustrated in Part 1 of this book](../part1/challenges.md#coding-challenges)
from a user's perspective. This appendix explains how a coding challenge can be added
to newly created hacking challenges.

Each coding challenge consists of two phases:

1. **Find It** where the user is tasked to select vulnerable line(s) of code in an actual code snippet from Juice Shop
2. **Fix It** where the user is presented with 3-4 options to choose from to fix that vulnerability and has to decide which one would be the best

## Vulnerable code snippets

Juice Shop allows associating its own vulnerable code with its own hacking challenges. To outfit new challenges with
such a code snippet, some conditions must be met, and a certain syntax for marking the code snippet have to be used.

### Supported source files

Juice Shop will perform a lookup for code snippets in these source files
or folders:

```
./server.ts
./routes
./lib
./data
./frontend/src/app
```

These are equally available when cloning the source code repo, running
the official Docker image or unpacking an official pre-packaged archive.

## `vuln-code-snippet` marker comments

All marker comments relevant for the code snippet processing start with
the `vuln-code-snippet` prefix followed by the type of marker, often
followed by the challenge key(s) the marker should be applied to.

| Marker Type  | Challenge Key(s) | Description                                                                                                            | Example                                                              |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`      | Yes              | Beginning of a snippet for one or more challenges.                                                                     | `// vuln-code-snippet start localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge`     |
| `end`        | Yes              | End of a snippet for one or more challenges.                                                                           | `// vuln-code-snippet end localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge`       |
| `vuln-line`  | Yes              | Vulnerable code line for one or more challenges. Can appear multiple times within a corresponding `start`-`end` block. | `// vuln-code-snippet vuln-line localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge` |
| `hide-line`  | No               | That particular line will be removed from all code snippets.                                                           | `// vuln-code-snippet hide-line`                                     |
| `hide-start` | No               | Beginning of a block that will be removed from all code snippets.                                                      | `// vuln-code-snippet hide-start`                                    |
| `hide-end`   | No               | End of a block that will be removed from all code snippets.                                                            | `// vuln-code-snippet hide-end`                                      |

Code snippet markers are recognized in any files as long as they support
a leading `//` or `#` for a single-line comment. This makes them usable
in TypeScript, JavaScript and YAML files, but not in HTML. Code markers
are only found in files residing in one of the above-mentioned folders.

#### Complete examples

##### TypeScript

The following code shows markers for two challenges with the same
vulnerable line, and a hidden code block:

```typescript
// vuln-code-snippet start localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge
filterTable () {
let queryParam: string = this.route.snapshot.queryParams.q
if (queryParam) {
  queryParam = queryParam.trim()
  this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => { // vuln-code-snippet hide-start
    this.io.socket().emit('verifyLocalXssChallenge', queryParam)
  }) // vuln-code-snippet hide-end
  this.dataSource.filter = queryParam.toLowerCase()
  this.searchValue = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(queryParam) // vuln-code-snippet vuln-line localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge
  this.gridDataSource.subscribe((result: any) => {
    if (result.length === 0) {
      this.emptyState = true
    } else {
      this.emptyState = false
    }
  })
} else {
  this.dataSource.filter = ''
  this.searchValue = undefined
  this.emptyState = false
}
}
// vuln-code-snippet end localXssChallenge xssBonusChallenge
```

The next example explains how to mark one challenge with two vulnerable
lines, and some individually hidden lines:

```typescript
// vuln-code-snippet start fileWriteChallenge
function handleZipFileUpload ({ file }, res, next) {
  if (utils.endsWith(file.originalname.toLowerCase(), '.zip')) {
    if (file.buffer && !utils.disableOnContainerEnv()) { // vuln-code-snippet hide-line
      const buffer = file.buffer
      const filename = file.originalname.toLowerCase()
      const tempFile = path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename)
      fs.open(tempFile, 'w', function (err, fd) {
        if (err != null) { next(err) }
        fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, buffer.length, null, function (err) {
          if (err != null) { next(err) }
          fs.close(fd, function () {
            fs.createReadStream(tempFile)
              .pipe(unzipper.Parse()) // vuln-code-snippet vuln-line fileWriteChallenge
              .on('entry', function (entry) {
                const fileName = entry.path
                const absolutePath = path.resolve('uploads/complaints/' + fileName)
                utils.solveIf(challenges.fileWriteChallenge, () => { return absolutePath === path.resolve('ftp/legal.md') }) // vuln-code-snippet hide-line
                if (absolutePath.includes(path.resolve('.'))) {
                  entry.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('uploads/complaints/' + fileName).on('error', function (err) { next(err) })) // vuln-code-snippet vuln-line fileWriteChallenge
                } else {
                  entry.autodrain()
                }
              }).on('error', function (err) { next(err) })
          })
        })
      })
    } // vuln-code-snippet hide-line
    res.status(204).end()
  } else {
    next()
  }
}
// vuln-code-snippet end fileWriteChallenge
```

##### YAML

In this example, multiple challenges are defined in a shared code block
but each with their own vulnerable line:

```yaml
# vuln-code-snippet start resetPasswordBjoernOwaspChallenge resetPasswordBjoernChallenge resetPasswordJimChallenge resetPasswordBenderChallenge resetPasswordUvoginChallenge
-
  question: 'Your eldest siblings middle name?' # vuln-code-snippet vuln-line resetPasswordJimChallenge
-
  question: "Mother's maiden name?"
-
  question: "Mother's birth date? (MM/DD/YY)"
-
  question: "Father's birth date? (MM/DD/YY)"
-
  question: "Maternal grandmother's first name?"
-
  question: "Paternal grandmother's first name?"
-
  question: 'Name of your favorite pet?' # vuln-code-snippet vuln-line resetPasswordBjoernOwaspChallenge
-
  question: "Last name of dentist when you were a teenager? (Do not include 'Dr.')"
-
  question: 'Your ZIP/postal code when you were a teenager?' # vuln-code-snippet vuln-line resetPasswordBjoernChallenge
-
  question: 'Company you first work for as an adult?' # vuln-code-snippet vuln-line resetPasswordBenderChallenge
-
  question: 'Your favorite book?'
-
  question: 'Your favorite movie?' # vuln-code-snippet vuln-line resetPasswordUvoginChallenge
-
  question: 'Number of one of your customer or ID cards?'
-
  question: "What's your favorite place to go hiking?"
# vuln-code-snippet end resetPasswordBjoernOwaspChallenge resetPasswordBjoernChallenge resetPasswordJimChallenge resetPasswordBenderChallenge resetPasswordUvoginChallenge
```

#### Overlapping markers

After a code snippet has been retrieved and processed, all "dangling"
markers inside starting with `vuln-code-snippet` will be removed. This
allows to have overlapping `start` and `end` blocks for different
challenges that might share some but not all code.

### REST endpoints

The Score Board retrieves the actual code snippets via two REST
endpoints:

* `/snippets` returns the list of all challenge keys where code snippets
  are available in JSON format (e.g.
  `{"challenges":["directoryListingChallenge",...,"xssBonusChallenge"]}`)
* `/snippets/<challengeKey>` returns the actual code snippet plus the
  list of vulnerable lines in JSON format (e.g. `{"snippet":"filterTable
  () {\n let queryParam: string = ... }\n }","vulnLines":[6]}`)

#### Error handling

The following errors can occur when calling the REST endpoints:

| Endpoint                   | HTTP status code | Error                                                |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `/snippets/<challengeKey>` | `412`            | `Unknown challenge key: <challengeKey>`              |
| `/snippets/<challengeKey>` | `404`            | `No code snippet available for: <challengeKey>`      |
| `/snippets/<challengeKey>` | `422`            | `Broken code snippet boundaries for: <challengeKey>` |

#### Real-time retrieval

As the code snippets are retrieved in real-time from the actual code
base, all changes to the marker syntax while the application is running
are immediately applied and can be tested by re-opening the particular
snippet from the Score Board. Newly added code snippets are similarly
recognized by reloading the Score Board page. No frontend complation or
server restart is required.
